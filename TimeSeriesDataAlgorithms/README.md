### LearningLatentRepresentationsProject:
This project is a summary of my final work for my class CS 598 Deep Learning for Health Care. This project worked to evaluate, update and extend the works of the given authors in classifying patient survival outcomes for ICU stays using the MIMIC-iii dataset. My final results show a minor improvement in performance over the original authors through refinement of feature selection. This is accomplished through
feature reduction using autoencoders to create a latent space model, then fed into various models including logistic regression, and various LSTM models.
