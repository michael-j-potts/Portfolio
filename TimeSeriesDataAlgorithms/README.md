This folder contains scripts for converting Iquvia claims data into organized patient data based on ICD-10 Code. This was part of my internship, but some algorithmic models. During this time, I worked on and became very familiar with Neural Backed Decision Trees.

As well, I have included a working copy of my stock prediction program, which converts daily stock information into a time series data set, and uses several neural network models to predict stock prices.
