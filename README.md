This Portfolio is currently under construction. Here are some of my projects:

### HeartDiseaseClassifier (in progress):
This project is currently under construction. I have completed the data cleaning phase, and have begun to implement 3 algorithms out of a list of 7-8 expected. The end result of this project will be classifying if patients have heart disease or not based on other pertinent features. 

### IOTProjects (completed):
This folder contains code for several projects that I worked on as a student. First, an basic autonomous robotic car that uses an ultrasonic sensor to make its immidiate physical location and distances from objects. The vehicle then relies on basic decision making for how to circumnavigate around objects to arrive at its inputted coordinate destination. RemoteAccess contains the code to control the vehicle via bluetooth and wifi through a d3 web implementation which allows for system monitoring and vehicle control. 

### KivySkeleton (skeleton):
This folder contains some skeleton examples of my initial exposure to kivy, a python based framework to create android applications. 

### LearningLatentRepresentationsProject (completed):
This project is a summary of my final work for my class CS 598 Deep Learning for Health Care. This project worked to evaluate, update and extend the works of the given authors in classifying patient survival outcomes for ICU stays using the MIMIC-iii dataset. My final results show a minor improvement in performance over the original authors through refinement of feature selection.

### TimeSeriesDataAlgorithms (skeleton):
This project was taken from my time in the Sunstella research program working with Iquvia claims data. This includes the data cleaning steps as well as several baseline algorithms.

### Visualizations (completed):
This file contains a tableau chart of the average global life expectancy compared to health expenditures per capita.
